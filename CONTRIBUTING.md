# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned developer. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## General Project Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request for review.

## Getting Items on the Agenda

To propose new features or changes, please open an issue in the repository. Clearly describe your suggestion and its benefits. The team will review it and decide whether to add it to the agenda.

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions are made collaboratively by the core team, considering input from all contributors. Major changes will be discussed in issues or pull requests to gather feedback.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Technical Guidelines

- **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `myFunctionName`).
- **Issue Tags**: Tag issues with appropriate labels such as `bug`, `feature`, or `enhancement` to categorize them effectively.
- **Installation and Configuration**: Follow the installation instructions in the README to set up the development environment. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Additional Notes

- Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- Before submitting a pull request, make sure to run tests to verify that your changes do not break existing functionality.
